# CPDN
Based on CVPR 2018 paper: Learning to Compare: Relation Network for Few-Shot Learning (Zero-Shot Learning part)
PyTorch code for SPL 2020 letter: Class-Prototype Discriminative Network for Generalized Zero-shot Learning

# Requirements
Python 2.7
Pytorch 0.3

# Data
Download data from [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~lz/DEM_cvpr2017/data.zip) and unzip it unzip data.zip.

# Run
python AwA1_cpdn.py will give you ZSL and GZSL performance on AwA1 with attribute under GBU setting

python AwA2_cpdn.py will give you ZSL and GZSL performance on AwA2 with attribute under GBU setting 

python CUB_cpdn.py will give you ZSL and GZSL performance on CUB with attribute under GBU setting 

# Note
Please load pre-trained parameters of RN for quickly training.
